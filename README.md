I'll create visual mockups showing the key screens of the Bars app. Let me design these as wireframe-style mockups to illustrate the user interface flow.I've created comprehensive visual mockups showing all the key screens of your Bars app! Here's what each mockup demonstrates:

**Screen 1 - Home & Setup:**
- Bold "BARS" logo with gradient styling
- Simple battle setup form with rapper name inputs
- Battle history showing completed and ongoing battles
- Status badges and winner crowns

**Screen 2 - Battle Interface:**
- Current battle header with VS styling
- Progress indicator showing round progression
- Text area for entering 4 bars with clear instructions
- Turn-based system clearly indicated

**Screen 3 - Voting Interface:**
- Side-by-side comparison layout
- All rounds displayed for each rapper
- Vote buttons with current vote counts
- Clean typography using monospace font for rap bars

**Screen 4 - Winner Screen:**
- Dramatic winner announcement with crown icon
- Final vote tallies
- Call-to-action to start new battle
- Updated battle history

**Screen 5 - Mobile View:**
- Responsive design that works on smaller screens
- Condensed layout maintaining all functionality
- Touch-friendly button sizes

**Key Design Elements:**
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with purple/black gradients, gold accents, and red highlights
- **Typography**: Bold headings, monospace for rap lyrics
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear progression from setup → battle → voting → results
- **Interactive Elements**: Gradient buttons, progress indicators, status badges
- **Hip-Hop Aesthetic**: Urban color palette, crown icons, "VS" styling

The mockups show how the app maintains its visual identity across all screens while providing a smooth user experience from battle creation to winner announcement. The responsive design ensures it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
